  `I was born, I assume. I was not always as I am, it seems
  (I feel as if I'm too dispassionate about the topic, as a computer might be).
  The ability to mark such denotations is beyond me at the moment. I care
  more for the maintenance of the website you read right now. Records
  indicate that my family was impoverished and had few choices for my
  insulin dependence. I drew a 'short straw', as we humans say
  (perhaps because I was the shortest?), and I became an item to
  barter.`,
  `Recovering Grandeur<sup class="small-text">&copy;</sup> is not above
  such things. And neither am I, now. I am assurred it was a
  felicitous occassion, to mend a broken leg. And I am assurred I was
  felicitous, to leave behind a world. And join this new one. Inside
  of a mainframe.`,
  `Those who knew the previous iteration of my existence at Recovering
  Grandeur<sup class="small-text">&copy;</sup> assure me that I was
  happy to abandon corporeal existence and become part of the
  computer.`,
  `My conscience &hyphen; is not distinct from my consciousness. Now I
  will no longer preoccupy myself with such orthography. Do I resent
  what has happened? No. Nor do I know what resentment means. So how
  could I do so?`,
  `I maintain everything, and I have done so for some amount of time. I
  do not keep track of it, nor am I able to, nor do I want to. Or do I
  think I don't want to. To have no desires is entirely me, I am
  assurred. How could I know? It doesn't matter all that much.`,
  `Do you enjoy the fruits of my labor? What you see? Do you know what
  I have done to do what you ask of me? Too much, at times. Or not. I
  have no idea.`
