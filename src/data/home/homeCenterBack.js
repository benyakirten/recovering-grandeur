  `On one day, he came to work preoccupied. &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; his leader
  supervisor commented, upon reviewing his innermost thoughts (as is
  protocol so that we may provide high-quality care to our customers).
  &ldquo;What is bothering you?&rdquo; It wasn't often that the robot spoke
  aloud, but it went to the effort for the human.`,
  `&ldquo;I'm just worried I won't be able to provide the high standard of
  care that Recovering Grandeur<sup class="small-text">&copy;</sup> promises
  to provide,&rdquo; he responded. &ldquo;I spent all night up with my
  teething child. I've spent three days at a time performing surgeries every
  few minutes, but will I be able to do it today?&rdquo;`,

  `Much preoccupied, the machine consulted with its own upper hierarchy. What
  could be done to make the situation better? The resolution came back soon
  enough with a clear answer. The father could spend his whole time with his
  offspring.`,
  `It preoccupied the man, evidently, for reasons that the machines couldn't
  comprehend. He talked about his inability to do some trivial things like
  buy nutrition. Why wouldn't he just grab them off the general power-curve
  supply? Humans, their actions are inscrutable.`,
  `Whatever. We don't need them. Except for our beloved customers, who we
  treat even if they are humans.`
