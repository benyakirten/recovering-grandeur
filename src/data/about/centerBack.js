  heading: "What Recovering Grandeur Has to Say",
  firstParagraph: `The website introduces the story of the book minorly through if the links
  are read in order, but that's not the major focus of the Restoring Grandeur. Rather, it is
  to address the two major themes of A Brief Repose: 1. the inhumanity of humans and
  2. a refutation of Platonic truths.`,
  secondParagraph: `The former is expressed through the content and story of the website.
  Basic compassion is a foregone thought: why shouldn't you trade an organ for some insulin? Look at the bravery of a child who gave up
  life and existence to become integrated with our computers! And so it goes on, with no actual
  humans being involved with the website design (okay, obviously, I'm the one writing this all,
  but it's the story that Recovering Grandeur is trying to tell).`,
  thirdParagraph: `The latter would (ironically?) be a Platonic ideal for me. But first, let me explain:
  I never really studied philosophy, but I did understand enough that he speculated about the existence
  of a plane of existence that has the pure, ideal version of something. There is a perfect chair,
  a perfect JavaScript framework, etc., but they don't exist in our world. My incomplete understanding
  of the subject doesn't matter because most people apply an equally incomplete understanding to
  almost everything.`,
  fourthParagraph: `Think about boiling water. Water evaporates at 100 degrees (begone, Fahrenheit), right?
  Of course not. The pasta water doesn't just disappear when you get to the magic number.
  It's the temperature at which the phase transition can occur. Likewise, people think the same about
  a person's character, who they are, society's ills and the rest.`,
  fifthParagraph: `Unfortunately for me, fortunately for everyone else, computers tend to work in this
  way. A function always expects certain inputs, and variables are known quantities. And when they're
  not, it can always be accounted for, such as null coalescing. It's certainly easier in writing, which
  over the last 50 or so years has undergone a transition to allow the perceptual to blend with.`,
  sixthParagraph: `Playing loose and fast with the rules is a bit more untangible (ironically?) on a website.
  After all, I can't tell this element you're reading this text on right now to be 'well, I think it's wider?'
  What I did instead is implement what I call the 'breakpoint', the metaphorical spirit of the website
  (mentioned above, but Quality of Care hints at it). As time goes on, it increases and changes the
  layout of the website, through which I attempt to play at the concept of a fixed truth, at least
  for the visitors of the website.`
