  heading: "What Recovering Grandeur Has to Say",
  firstParagraph: `This website is supposed to accompany A Brief Repose, but it only minorly touches on
  the story. It focuses instead on two of the major themes of the book:
   1. the inhumanity of humans and 2. a plea for people to abandon their attachment to Platonic truths.`,
  secondParagraph: `The former is expressed through the content and story of the website.
  Hopefully, by now you've noticed the jankiness of the website. It's the point. What you're seeing is
  (fictionally, obviously) designed by robots with only a passing knowledge of humans.
  Basic compassion is a foregone thought: why shouldn't you trade an organ for some insulin?
  Look at the bravery of a child who gave up life and existence to become integrated with our computers!
  And so it goes on, with no actual humans being involved with the website design (okay, obviously, I'm the one writing this all,
  but it's the story that Recovering Grandeur is trying to tell).`,
  thirdParagraph: `The latter would (ironically?) be a Platonic ideal for me. But first, let me explain:
  I never really studied philosophy, but I did understand enough that Plato speculated about the existence
  of a plane of existence that has the pure, ideal version of ever. There is a perfect chair,
  a perfect JavaScript framework, etc., but they don't exist in our world. My incomplete understanding
  of the subject doesn't matter because most people apply an equally incomplete understanding to
  almost everything.`,
  fourthParagraph: `Think about boiling water. Water evaporates at 100 degrees (begone, Fahrenheit), right?
  Of course not. The pasta water doesn't just disappear when you get to the magic number.
  It's the temperature at which the phase transition can occur -- and before anyone says
  'well, actually' know this: my ignorance about the subject is the point. Everyone has topics
  that they know little about and so they allow for simplifications and absolute truths.`,
  fifthParagraph: `So how do I address this on a website? Unfortunately for me and fortunately for everyone else,
  computers tend to work on universal truths, at least when it comes to something as abstract as a website.
  A function always expects certain inputs, and variables are known quantities. And when they're
  not, it can always be accounted for, such as null coalescing.`,
  sixthParagraph: `The best way I could think of adding in a refutation of absolute truths was
  by implementing something I call the 'breakpoint.' As time goes on, it increases and changes the layout and design
  of what you see. The idea is that (after a certain point) every time you look at a page,
  you'll say 'hey, wait, this looks different.'`
