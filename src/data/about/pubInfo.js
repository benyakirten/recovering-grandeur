  title: "Delusions of Form",
  description: `The Recovering Grandeur website accompanies Delusions of Form, a book telling
  the story of John Albuquerque and the recovery from his coma.
  Between visions of cosmological abandonment and vague scenes from others' lives,
  he starts to piece together who he is: a recently graduated high schooler who was
  getting ready to move on with his life. But with no idea of who or what he is,
  he has to make sense of what life means to and for him.`,

  miscInfo: `Set in the same universe and city as The Human Automata, Delusions of Form
  can be understood without reading any other book. It is loosely based on my own
  experience in a coma. Upon the end of my own experience, I long contemplated
  how I would articulate what happened to me. Delusions of Form attempts to capture the feeling,
  rather than the truth of the situation.`,
