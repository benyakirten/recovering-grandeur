  title: "Delusions of Form",
  description: `The Recovering Grandeur website accompanies Delusions of Form:
    The world has lost all sense, or John Albuquerque cannot find any sense to it.
    Reality drops into the abyss as he crosses an endless desert.
    A factory disassembles his memories as he investigates his unresolved feelings.
    A house party ends with the disintegration of his body. But forget that.
    He only cares about one thing: that he exists. Well, he can’t say that with certainty.
    The cosmos has abandoned him, and likewise, any way to know the truth is long gone, much less if such a concept exists.
    Inspired by the author’s experiences in a coma, follow John Albuquerque on the many paths of a mind in decline.`,

  miscInfo: `Though it is set in the same universe as The Human Automata, Delusions of Form
    is a stand-alone book. It is loosely based on my own
    experience in a coma. I long contemplated how I would articulate what happened to me, and
    Delusions of Form attempts to capture the feeling, rather than the truth of the situation.`,
