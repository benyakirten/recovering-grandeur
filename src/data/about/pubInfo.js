  title: "A Brief Repose",
  description: `The Recovering Grandeur website accompanies A Brief Respose, a book telling
  the story of John Albuquerque. Between visions of cosmological abandonment and vague
  scenes from others' lives, he starts to piece together who he is: a recently
  graduated high schooler who was getting ready to move on with his life. But with
  no idea of who or what he is, he has to make sense of what life means to and for him.`,

  miscInfo: `Set in the same universe and city as The Human Automata, A Brief Repose
  can be understood without reading any other book. It is loosely based on my own
  experience in a coma. Upon the end of my own experience, I long contemplated
  how I would articulate what happened to me. A Brief Repose captures the feeling
  of what it's like.`,
