export default {
  breakpointToolbar: `Breakpoint is the voice of the ghost behind Recovering Grandeur. It will change,
  autonomously, all of the other settings here (and other things) if those options are enabled.`,
  breakpointExplanationToolbar: `The higher the breakpoint, the probability and severity of changes
  performed by the ghost.`,
  breakpointMaximumToolbar: `Breakpoint maximum is the maximum to which the breakpoint can get, obviously.
  What this practically means is two things:
  1. the probability for changes continues to increase past 100, and
  2. at maximum breakpoint, a modal will pop up, to end the story.`,
  maxAddToolbar: `Each time the breakpoint changes, it can increment between zero and this maximum`,
  minimumToolbar: `The ghost will act only if the breakpoint exceeds the minimum score`
